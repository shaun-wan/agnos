A day at a coffee shop!

- A customer visits a coffee shop that sells a bunch of items (e.g. beverages, sandwiches, etc.).

- Items have varying tax rates and some are free or offered at a discount when ordered with another item.

- The customer is made aware of the order total and once he pays for it, he can wait until notified of the order completion.

- You are required to describe a program with a set of interfaces that models the above problem at hand. You need to design the DB and backend architecture and implement it. 
- Front-end is not mandatory but your endpoints should be reachable through Postman (please attach postman collection).

- Users should be able to see the list of available items, User should be able to order them and should get a notification after a fixed amount of time that their order is ready.

- Unit test cases are not mandatory.

- Tech Stack - Ruby on Rails. You can also show us your front-end skills in some JS technologies (React/Angular, etc) or Bootstrap, or plain Html/JS.
